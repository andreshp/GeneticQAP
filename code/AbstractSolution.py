    Class which represents an abstract solution.
    A solution has five essential methods:
    - The init method, where the solution data is initialized. 
      It calls the initializeData method.
    - The initializeData method, where the solution is fully initialized.
      It must be implemented for each problem.
    - The getObjectiveValue method, which return the solution's objective
      value.
    - The computeObjectiveValue method, which computes the solution's objective 
      value and must be implemented for each problem.
    - The fullPrint method, which prints the whole solution. It must also be
      implemented for each problem.

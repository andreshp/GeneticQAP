    Class which represents an abstract problem.
    A problem has two essential methods:
    - The init method, which is passed a file's name which has the problem information.
      The file and the problem names are saved. Then it calls to the parseFile method to
      obtain the problem information.
    - The parseFile method, which reads the problem information from the given file.
      It must be implemented for each problem.
